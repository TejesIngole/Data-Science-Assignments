# Data Science Assignments

## Overview
This repository contains a structured collection of hands-on data science assignments covering the full analytics and machine learning lifecycle. The work demonstrates practical implementation of concepts using real-world datasets and industry-standard tools.


## Topics Covered
- Python fundamentals and statistical analysis  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing  
- Supervised learning (Regression, Classification)  
- Unsupervised learning (Clustering, PCA, Market Basket Analysis)  
- Ensemble and boosting models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM)  
- Neural Networks and deep learning basics  
- Recommendation systems  
- Time series analysis and forecasting  

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost, LightGBM
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Statistical and ML evaluation techniques

## Objective
To build a strong foundation in data science by applying theoretical concepts to practical problems, focusing on data understanding, model building, evaluation, and insight generation.

## Usage
Each assignment is organized logically within the repository and can be executed independently. Notebooks and scripts include clear steps for data loading, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
